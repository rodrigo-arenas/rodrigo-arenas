### :rocket:About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently interested in data science-related projects, such as machine learning, optimization, MLOps and statistics.
- :raised_back_of_hand: I’m looking to help with open-source projects and research focused on machine learning. Let me a message if you think I can help you.
- :pencil: I like writing and making some tutorials about data science on [Medium](https://rodrigo-arenas.medium.com/)
- :computer: I'm currently working on:
  - [sklearn-genetic-opt](https://github.com/rodrigo-arenas/Sklearn-genetic-opt) a package for scikit-learn models hyperparameters tuning and feature selection, using evolutionary algorithms with extra tools like callbacks, plotting, logging, etc.
